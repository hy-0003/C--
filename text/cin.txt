No one is born being good at all things. You become good at things through hard work. You are not a varsity athlete the first time you play a new sport. You don not hit every note the first time you sing a song.You have got to practice. The same principle applies to your schoolwork. You might have to do a math problem a few times before you get it right. You might have to read something a few times before you understand it.You definitely have to do a few drafts of a paper before it is good enough to hand in.
